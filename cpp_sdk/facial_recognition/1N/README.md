# Trueface SDK C++ Sample App
## Facial Recognition - 1:N Identification
This sample app demonstrates the use of 1:N matching. Templates are first generated and enrolled into a collection with their associated ID.
Next, all faces are extracted from the camera frame and used to generate templates. If any of these templates match those in the collection, the identity is draw on the image.
